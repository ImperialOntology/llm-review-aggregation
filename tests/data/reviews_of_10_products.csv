133689,B01EE1FVJU,1,"Love the brush but the makeup falls short. The colors seem slightly darker in the picture than in person. I'm sure this is fine for people of fairer complexions, but I am a lighter skinned African American and the darkest color doesn't really show on my skin. My skin tone is usually called caramel or toffee when I buy drug store makeup (hope that helps give a visual image for anyone wondering). Since the darkest color doesn't show much, this limits the amount of contouring I can do with this pallet alone. The other colors seem ok and this could be a good starter set for someone with a lighter complexion.",3.0

The palette being expensive and my money being tight around the holidays I decided to turn to amazon for a cheaper alternative. I was skeptical ordering this because the one I have been using is such a high quality but upon receiving it and swatching it, it was very pigmented and went on smoothly! It even has one more color than my tarte palette. Then on top of it all it has this amazing brush with it, I love this little brush! Great for blending, I like it more than my beauty blender.

92875,B01N4KHVLA,1,I liked this deep cleansing mask.  It dries quickly and easy to peel off.  It is a little painful but not too bad.  It didn't get all the blackheads but it did get some out. I was still happy with the purchase even though it didn't get all the blackheads.  My face feels and looks so clean and smooth after using the mask.  It works better than the last cleanser I was using that left my face really dry.,4.0

180014,B01N4KHVLA,1,"I heard about this type of black cleansing Japanese masks from different sources and saw some youtube videos people trying it out and saying that it hurts, but works and some saying that it does nothing and got very curious to try this out myself. My skin is medium type in pretty much all senses. Its not dry, not oily, I have very little acne and some blackheads, so trying this out I don't expect massive results either.<br /><br />Firstly, I felt a bit weird when it arrived with no instructions at all in the box and the instructions written on the box are not in English. So, not knowing how long should I keep first couple of times I kept the mask for about 15-20 minutes. I put a relatively thin layer and it got dry pretty quickly. I felt no pain at all taking it out and had very little effect if any at all in a sense of getting rid of blackheads. The main struggle with the mask is that you are not sure how much to put to keep it &quot;whole&quot; on your face, so that you can peel it later, but I feel like no matter how thin the layer is, and sometimes it might seem it gets disconnected, but actually it will be peeling off altogether.<br /><br />Another thing is that after listening to all these scary reviews, I was worried to try out on all of my face, so first few times I put some only on my nose. I only have blackheads on my nose. The effect was there, but very weak (I kept about 15 mins).<br /><br />Today I decided to try it out for all my face and keep it longer. I shall say, that my pain tolerance is higher than average. This time I understood why people were complaining about pain, but still I would definitely say that it is very much tolerable pain, and nothing even close to extreme. In a scale from 1 to 10, where one is a touch and 10 is a bee sting, it would be a 2,5. But this time again the results were not super massive, but better than I expected to see (after first few times my expectations went down). I feel like it handled maybe around 30-40 percent of the blackheads, but also made my skin softer and smoother. Also while applying you should be careful not to put any on your hair or eyebrows, since you might have them removed with the mask. :)<br /><br />Overall, though there are no super extra massive effects, considering the low price, I would recommend people to try it out!",4.0
300650,B01N4KHVLA,1,This blackhead remover mask is probably one of the better masks that I've used. I've tried multiple washes and other masks and I always find myself back with this product. So what you do is you washing face off of warm water dry it off with a towel then apply the mask to the area that you like it. Then you let it dry once try you just peel off. Granite it does take some time for it to dry but personally I think it has the best effect. One of my favorite things is that this is in a bottle and I don't have to use a whole packet each time I decide to use it. It's really convenient when it's in the bottle. All and all I have to say I'm really happy with this blackhead remover. I hope you agree :-),5.0
188486,B01N4KHVLA,1,Great item but it took forever to get here. So be warned it is coming from Asia. Its like the action of a pore strip but more intense for your whole face. Its a thick black gel that you put on and it takes 30 min or so to dry on and then you peel it off. You have to hold your skin tight when peeling it off or it will hurt. It does sort of feel like its taking the top layer of skin off. My skin is sort of sensitive so some parts hurt to feel off but goodness the clarity it brings to your face and pores. I did this the day before a facial and the aesthetician even commented how clear it looked. She didn't even have to do extractions. I really like it and would buy it again. BUT its all written in Chinese on the packaging and on the website. I want to know what ingredients are in this and can't seem to find them anywhere,4.0

508936,B07SY7WPS4,1,Alright so I got this for me and my husband to try on his vacation which we did this on 9/10/21 it is now 1/29/21. I will start from the beginning. This was the first time ever doing anything like this for me and my husband so we werent sure what to expect with the process. When you take these out I will caution you to watch how much you cute the parts that go on your feet as I cut my husband's too wide and some of the liquid that is inside did come out. So you know there is liquid inside each of the bags that go on your feet that feels weird on your feet and cold. We left on for the recommended time of an hour the process is explained in detail which I will give them kuddos for. Now after we let them stay on for an hour we then showered them off I placed lotion on my feet the first night again not sure what to expect and I didnt want this to dry my feet out too much as to where my husband didnt have a preference so he did not lotion his feet. He started seeing the peeling first. Now keep in mind I do get pedis and my last one was probably in March of 2020 and since then I have used a foot file and soak during that time. My peeling did not start until halfway thru the week so I thought that was important to mention. He does not get his feet done and never has. His peeling lasted about a week. We are about what a week and half in of peeling 2 weeks in since I did the foot mask my feet still look aweful and they are still peeling. I have started to apply lotion to the feet to see if this will help the process and only have seen minimal improvement. Now keep in mind I am an impatient person. Also to mention a burning and tingling sensation is expected its what we felt during the process once we were done. Overall I think I will stick to my parifan drips and doing my feet the way I have been doing I will say that it did wear down a few calluses I had on my feet its just the process I am not patient enough for I dont mind wearing socks too much but this is more of being forced to wear socks so I dont shed everywhere and even then I still find dead skin somewhere. This process was horrible to me and I think there are better ways to get these results. My husband didnt too much mind the process and his feet were in worse conditon than mind and his process didnt take as long and for me that was even more frustrating. This would not be something I would recommend unless you are a patient person and dont mind waiting like this for results I just want to let my feet breath again.<br /><br />Update: 2/2 My foot is still peeling this is def something I will not be doing again for me its about the fact that this is suppose to be something that takes time but really this amount of time for me is ridiculous and I can get the results its providing by using a foot file after soaking is that process more difficult yes but I get results within an hour not almost a month. My feet look nasty and dry even lotion isn't helping.,2.0
323443,B07SY7WPS4,1,This mask was absolutely amazing. Gave me the best results. I donâ€™t go to the salon anymore I just take care of my feet with the mask. Not to mention that the peeling is satisfying,5.0
528488,B07SY7WPS4,1,Iâ€™ve used several foot peels. I usually see peeling after two weeks. This one started within a week. Definitely soak feet in any temperature water and it loosens the skin. It happen to be watering and my feet were soaked from the hose and I noticed the peeling.,5.0
237737,B07SY7WPS4,1,"Peeling starts about 4 days after first application. It works better after a hot bath, that seems to activate peeling. Does not completely peel dead skin on heels. It peels for about a week or two",4.0
97005,B07SY7WPS4,1,The foot mask will have your feet feeling like a baby's feet after using it. It takes a while for your foot to begin peeling. When it starts peeling it looks horrible. I advise you to follow the instruction. If you have sensitive I would advise you to not use it.,4.0

The magnets are well attached and I can get several wears out of them if I gently clean them with makeup remover & a makeup remover wipe.  They seem to be longer than most brands too. Longer strip that the magnetic are attached to (someone with small eyes may need to trim them) and the length of the individual lashes are quite long - on 1 set I did trim the lash length of the inner corner (it felt like it was up to my eyebrow lol You won't need your traditional eyeliner - I find I get a good hold with what they've provided, but this liner ""Arishine Magnetic Eyeliner, Natural Look,Waterproof and Smudge Resistant"" I found on Amazon has a SUPER, long lasting hold - some say too much cuz it takes a little work to remove.

602871,B08C24Q6LB,1,I could tell from the strength in the Brilliant Beauty Eyelash curler right from the get-go that this tool had some power and I was right! Thank you for creating such a fine cosmetic tool. Your pricing is also fabulous. ðŸ’–,5.0
437547,B08C24Q6LB,1,"I have pretty small, hooded eyes, so itâ€™s hard to find a lash curler that works for my eyes. The biggest issue I have is them pinching my eye when Iâ€™m clamping down to curl them. I always have to lightly clamp down to see if Iâ€™ll pinch myself and, if I will, then adjust. Then, I end up having some parts not curled. Iâ€™d been looking for a new curler for a while, when I saw this I figured it was worth a try since I also got mascara.<br /><br />Someone in the reviews had said the package came damaged. Mine also did. It wasnâ€™t too bad, just seemed a little beat up. But, the products inside were completely fine and didnâ€™t seem damaged at all, so I was okay with that.<br /><br />I am very picky about my mascara. Well, not so much the mascara as I am the mascara wand. With my small, hooded eyes, it makes it so I end up with a lot of mistakes of the wand hitting below my lower lash line or onto my hood. So, I prefer thinner wands. I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect with this mascara, but I was also getting a lash curler so I figured Iâ€™d hopefully like at least 1 of them. Iâ€™m happy to say that the mascara wand isnâ€™t too thick. Itâ€™s not extremely thin, but still thin enough so it works for me. It also has a little bend to it, which helps with application. The mascara goes on very easily and doesnâ€™t clump up after a few coats, which is great! It stays on all day without smearing. But, it also washes off easily at the end of the day, which I always love. Itâ€™s hard to find a mascara that stays all day without smearing or smudging, but is easy to wash off. So, itâ€™s nice this does both!<br /><br />The lash curler is amazing! Itâ€™s lightweight. It feels so nice. I love the red, black, and gold. It looks so fancy! It fits my eyes really well and curls my lashes AMAZINGLY without pinching my eyes at all! Iâ€™m really happy with it! It also comes with replacements for the rubber part on the curler, so that was great!<br /><br />For $11.99 (at the time of writing this), itâ€™s an amazing deal! Youâ€™re getting an amazing lash curler and an amazing mascara. You canâ€™t beat that! If youâ€™re looking for a great mascara, a great lash curler, or both, you should definitely give this a try!",5.0
510334,B08C24Q6LB,1,"This mascara and eyelash curler combo has its pros and cons:<br /><br />The mascara - I actually really like this mascara, which I didn't expect, given the price and the cheap packaging it comes in. The formula is smooth and glides on easily, and the curled brush on the wand is dense enough and shaped just right to get every little lash. But most importantly, it stays on ALL day without running or flaking. I'd say it's pretty waterproof, but also comes off easily with eye makeup remover. I had a brand for mascara that I have been loyal to for years, but this is my new go-to in my makeup bag. And the price is great! My only issue with it is that it dries very quickly, so any mistake you make isn't going to budge. It also means that it's easy to make the lashes stick together if you don't apply it carefully.<br /><br />The eyelash curler - Actually I only have cons about this one. I hate it. It's shaped in a way that makes it difficult to use. The finger grips are set too far apart, making it awkward to squeeze, and the shape of the press is odd and it to angle my lashes into it. It's basically useless, and I tossed it in favor of my simple revlon lash curler.<br /><br />This mascara, however, I will be buying again!",4.0

When it comes to mascara, I usually alternate between Mabeline and Cover Girl products, but I also dabble in false lashes. This is probably the best mascara I've tried so far. No pics I took do it justice.<br /><br />In terms of appearance, it really did a beautiful job of catching each lash and providing length and fullness, but somehow in a very natural way. It didn't look like I was wearing mascara at all- just like I had fuller natural lashes. I had no issues with clumps and it lasts throughout a full day/ night without any issues. It's actually the only one I know of that washes off cleanly too. Normally, I wind up having to use makeup remover and wind up scrubbing away racoon eyes when I take mine off. This rinsed away in the shower without issue.<br /><br />Needless to say, I'll be getting more when this runs out.",5.0

486048,B09GV9T5QF,1,Love how well the lashes bond with the liner. Must let the liner fully dry to achieve best result! Last tool AMAZING! NOT CHEAP PLASTIC. Nice feel in the hand. Doesn't burn if you get the liner in your eye. Also easy to remove when taking off lashes and liner. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY!,5.0
